  {
    q: "How much does it cost to build a web application in Africa?",
    a: "Our web application projects typically range from $8,000 for lean MVPs to $50,000+ for enterprise-grade platforms. Pricing depends on complexity, integrations, and timeline. We offer a free consultation to give you an accurate scoped estimate before any commitment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to develop a SaaS platform?",
    a: "A well-scoped SaaS MVP typically takes 8–14 weeks from kickoff to launch. Full-featured enterprise platforms can take 4–9 months. We use agile 2-week sprints so you see working software every two weeks, not just at the end.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with startups or only enterprises?",
    a: "Both. We work with funded startups building their first product and established enterprises modernizing legacy systems. Our minimum engagement is $8,000, which makes us a fit for serious founders and growing companies.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you integrate AI into our existing system?",
    a: "Yes — AI integration and augmentation of existing platforms is one of our core services. We've integrated LLMs, computer vision models, and predictive analytics engines into platforms built on various tech stacks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with international clients outside Africa?",
    a: "Absolutely. While we're based in Nairobi, we've delivered projects for clients in the UK, USA, UAE, and across Africa. We operate in UTC+3 and work asynchronously to accommodate any timezone.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after the project launches?",
    a: "We offer retainer-based maintenance packages covering bug fixes, performance monitoring, security patches, and feature iterations. Most clients stay on a monthly retainer post-launch.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I start a project with Axelo?",
    a: "Fill out our project intake form on the contact page. We respond within 24 hours to schedule a free 30-minute discovery call where we learn about your goals and propose an approach.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you sign NDAs?",
    a: "Every Axelo project begins with a 1-week deep dive discovery session where we map your business logic, technical requirements, and ROI goals. We sign mutual NDAs before any sensitive business information is shared. Client confidentiality is a core part of how we operate.",
  },
